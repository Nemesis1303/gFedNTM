        Class to register the connection of a client in the federation for the first time, i.e. for the agreement of a common vocabulary. 

        As the client gets registered into the federation when it sends a GRPC message to the server, a counter is kept in order to account for the number times a client has tried to communicate with it. To do so, we save each client identification obtained from the context as the key of a dictionary, incrementing by one its corresponding value at each time the client connects with the server. Additionally, an object the class FederationClient is added to the list clients in the federation at each time a new client connects to it.
